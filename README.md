1. **Logging Module**
   - [X] **Enhance Logs Endpoint**: Serve logs as plain text or JSON through the `/logs` route.

2. **HTTP Module**
   - [ ] **Error Handling**: Return more informative HTTP status codes and messages for errors (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `500 Internal Server Error`).

3. **General Enhancements**
   - [ ] **Code Optimization**: Avoid redundant cloning of `Arc<Database>` by passing references where possible.

4. **Database Module**
   - [ ] **Improve Efficiency**: Add a memory cache (e.g., `HashMap`) to speed up frequently accessed keys.

---

5. **Database Module**
   - [ ] **Batch Reads and Writes**: Implement a write buffer and batch read functionality to reduce I/O overhead.

6. **HTTP Module**
   - [ ] **Async Database Operations**: Offload database operations to a thread pool using `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`.

7. **Logging Module**
   - [ ] **Asynchronous Logging**: Use an async logging library (`tracing` or `tokio::task::spawn`) to offload file writes and reduce blocking.

8. **HTTP Module**
   - [ ] **Add Authentication**: Protect sensitive routes (e.g., `/insert`) with API key or token-based authentication.

---

9. **HTTP Module**
   - [ ] **Efficient Data Formats**: Use compact response formats for the `get` endpoint, serializing raw data for clients.

10. **Database Module**
    - [ ] **Checksum Optimization**: Avoid computing the checksum for all records during a `get` operation unless absolutely necessary.

11. **General Enhancements**
    - [ ] **Testing and Benchmarking**: Add unit and integration tests to ensure functionality and edge-case handling.

---

12. **Database Module**
    - [ ] **Indexing**: Introduce an in-memory index (e.g., `HashMap`) for fast key lookups. Periodically persist the index to disk.

13. **Logging Module**
    - [ ] **Buffer Size Management**: Dynamically adjust the buffer size during high traffic to reduce write frequency.

14. **Database Module**
    - [ ] **Concurrency Control**: Use thread-safe structures like `Arc<Mutex<T>>` or append-only log file structures to safely handle concurrent writes.

15. **HTTP Module**
    - [ ] **Route Optimization**: Refactor with Warp's `BoxedFilter` to minimize redundant cloning of `db` and `logger` filters.

---

16. **Database Module**
    - [ ] **File Segmentation**: Split the database file into smaller segments based on size or timestamp for efficient queries and easier backups.

17. **Database Module**
    - [ ] **Compaction**: Implement a background thread for merging fragmented data and removing outdated records.

---

18. **Logging Module**
    - [ ] **Structured Logging**: Format logs as structured JSON for better parsing and monitoring.

19. **General Enhancements**
    - [ ] **Scale for Concurrent Access**: Ensure proper synchronization mechanisms for safe concurrent database access.

---

20. **Database Module**
    - [ ] **Extend Data Structure**: Support more complex values (e.g., nested structures or lists) and add support for queries like "list all keys."

21. **Logging Module**
    - [ ] **Log Rotation and Archival**: Automatically rotate and compress old logs to save disk space.

---

22. **Database Module**
    - [ ] **Compression**: Integrate compression algorithms (e.g., Snappy or zlib) for data storage.

23. **General Enhancements**
    - [ ] **Resiliency**: Introduce checkpoints or snapshots for crash recovery.
